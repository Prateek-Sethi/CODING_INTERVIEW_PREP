The enclosed links have been curated based on all interviews I took, and since the questions differed, I have enclosed content relevant to anyone that I found appropriate. I'm doing this as content that's relevant to someone else might be relevant to you as well.

Also, understand that you are not required to absolutely master the concepts listed in the above given links. This is just to get you in the right mindset to prepare for the program.

We will also soon be discussing some good Codeforces/Codechef problems, so if you don't have much exposure to those kinds of questions, I would advise that take a little intro towards it.

With this, we hope to get you one step closer to your dream job!
